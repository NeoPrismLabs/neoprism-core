# Pushing Your NeoPrism Core Package to GitHub

Now that you've created the GitHub organization "NeoPrismLabs" and repository "neoprism-core", let's push your code to GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Initialize Git in Your Project (if not already done)

```bash
cd /home/rishi/StudioProjects/neoprismlabs/neoprism_core
git init
```

## Step 2: Create a .gitignore File

Before committing, create a proper .gitignore file for Flutter projects:

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

Add the following content to it:

```
# Miscellaneous

*.log
*.pyc
*.swp
.DS_Store

.buildlog/

## Step 3: Create a README.md File

Create an informative README for your repository:

```markdown
# NeoPrism Core

A Flutter UI toolkit featuring neobrutalism design principles with a pluggable architecture.

## Features

- Neobrutalism styled components
- Theme customization
- Plugin architecture for analytics, localization, and more

## Getting started

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  neoprism_core: ^0.0.1
```

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:neoprism_core/neoprism_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      theme: ThemeData.light().copyWith(
        extensions: [
          const NeoPrismThemeData(
            borderWidth: 4.0,
            borderRadius: 8.0,
          ),
        ],
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: NeoButton(
            id: 'my_button',
            label: 'Click Me',
            onPressed: () {},
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Components

- `NeoButton`: A neobrutalism styled button with press animation

## Additional information

This package is in active development. See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NeoPrismLabs/neoprism-core) for more information.
```

## Step 4: Add and Commit Your Files

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: NeoPrism Core with button component"
```

## Step 5: Connect to GitHub Remote Repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/NeoPrismLabs/neoprism-core.git
```

## Step 6: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If your default branch is named "master" instead of "main", use:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to:
1. Set up SSH keys for GitHub, or
2. Use a personal access token for HTTPS authentication

## Step 7: Verify the Repository

Visit `https://github.com/NeoPrismLabs/neoprism-core` to ensure your code was pushed successfully.

## Step 8: Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create a GitHub Actions workflow for testing your package:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create a file `.github/workflows/flutter.yml`:

```yaml
name: Flutter CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Flutter
      uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      with:
        flutter-version: '3.19.0'
        channel: 'stable'
    
    - name: Get dependencies
      run: flutter pub get
    
    - name: Analyze project
      run: flutter analyze
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: flutter test
```

Add and commit this file:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/flutter.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
git push
```

## Step 9: Configure Repository Settings

In GitHub, navigate to your repository settings:

1. **Description and Topics**:
   - Add a description and topics (like "flutter", "ui-toolkit", "neobrutalism")

2. **Default Branch**:
   - Confirm your default branch is correctly set

3. **Branch Protection**:
   - Set up branch protection rules for your main branch (optional)

4. **Collaborators & Teams**:
   - Add team members from your organization

## Step 10: Setup Documentation (Optional)

You can set up GitHub Pages to host your package documentation:

1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Set source to "main" branch and folder to "docs"
3. Create a docs folder in your repository for documentation

Now your NeoPrism Core package is properly set up on GitHub under your organization. The repository structure follows Flutter package best practices and includes all necessary files for collaboration and contribution.
